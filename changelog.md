### UPDATED:
- **Bewitchment** (FABRIC): 
  - added nonOpague() for _poppet_shelf_ related to [#690](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/WoodGood/issues/690)
  - Fixed _bark_ not being generated with **Better End** & **Better Nether** - also related to #690 above
- **TEXTURES** (FABRIC): 
  - Corrected **Terrestria**'s _lucernia_leaves_ not found (lucernia_hedge having purple/black texture, etc)
  - Corrected **Better Nether**'s _nether_mushroom_ side texture not found
- **Macaw's Fences & Walls** (FABRIC): 
  - Fixed _lucernia_hedge_'s missing texture
  - Excluded **Better Nether**'s _nether_reed_ & _nether_mushroom_ with log texture being used to texture the fences (Take a look at their texture, it's not a full 16x)
    - This is applied to other mods: **Clutter**, **Macaw's Stairs**, **Beautify Refabricated** (ALL FABRIC)
- **Farmer's Delight** (COMMON): Added cutting recipes for _door_, _sign_, _hanging_sign_, _wood_, _trapdoor_ from wood mods (Biomes O' Plenty, etc)
