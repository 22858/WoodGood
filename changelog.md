### UPDATED:
- **Wooden Hopper** (FABRIC): Updated the module - Added the missing shortenedID\
<span style="color: red">WARNING: I RECOMMENDED YOU TO BACKUP YOUR WORLD before updating EVERY COMPAT</span>
<br></br>
- **Wilder Wild** (FABRIC): Added the stripped_hollow_log to AxeBehaviors\
<span style="color: cyan">NOTE:</span> AxeBehavior is where you use axe to turn a _log_ into _hollow_log_, above meant _stripped_log_ is now included, not just _log_
<br></br>
- **EveryCompat** (COMMON): Blacklisted Dynamic Trees & its addons, so the hedges from these mods won't be generated.

- **Macaw's Fences & Walls** (FORGE): Fixed hedge's texture with **Intergrated Dynamic**'s _menril_leaves_
